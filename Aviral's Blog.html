  <h3>Question of the day</h3><br>
  <strong>What is life all about?</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>A healthy liver</li>
    <li>Sex</li>
    <li><a href="lespaul.html" target="_blank">a les paul</a></li>
    <li>A mere distraction</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If you feel that the answer is "A mere distraction" then you are <strong>WRONG.</strong></h2>
  <p>Life is much more positive than being a distraction.Its what you ware willing to fill it with. Like a bowl you can put in positive hobbies and skills.<br>You can put negative things as well but that's just boring.<br>Imagine someone who is
    always sad.If he is happy by doing an activity then why not do it.Brain is a very important tool.If left without any work it creates work by thinking and then overthinking.</p>
  <h3>Ask yourself these questions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Am I sad?</li>
    <li>Why am I sad?</li>
    <li>What makes me happy?</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Now simply reverse the order of the question to-</h3>
  <ol reversed start=3 type=I>
    <li>What makes me happy?</li>
    <li>After doing that thing,Am I still sad?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>But the 'I' point is <b>are you doing everything you can to be happy?</b></p>

<h4>Remember it all starts with you. Take care of yourself.If you cannot do that then you will always keep facing the same problems in life.<br>Learn to take a break.Find out what truely excites you and then <strong>Go for it</strong></h4>
<h3>Over the years I have been in and out of feeling low and completely unmotivated.In fact I am at that place right about now.Having a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3Ls28qBT5c" target="_blank">routine</a> helps me to have perspective.</h3>
